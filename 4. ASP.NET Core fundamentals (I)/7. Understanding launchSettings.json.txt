UNDERSTANDING launchSettings.json:


- it is used to configure the local development environment.

- it is not deployable.

- default launchSettings.json file contains 3 profiles:

    1) http             =   is used to run the application with the HTTP protocol.         
    2) https            =   is used to run the application with the HTTPS protocol. 
    3) IIS Express      =   is used to run the application in the IIS Express.

    -> 'commandName' field in the http and https profile is 'Project' this means the KESTRAL SERVER
        is launched to run the application.
    -> 'IISExpress' field is 'IIS Express' which means the application expects IIS Express to be the 
        web server.

- what is KESTREL SERVER ?
    -> cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core.
    -> Kestrel is included and enabled by default in ASP.NET Core project templates.
    -> ASP.NET Core can also be hosted in IIS Express.
    -> perfered web server

- What is IIS Express?
    -> not a cross-platform web server.

- when 'dotnet run', first profile(http) with the "commandName": "Project" is used.
    and in http profile, "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development" so the application runs in the
    Development environment.

- we can sepcify the profile to use when running the application using:
    dotnet run --launch-profiles https / dotnet run --launch-profiles http
    
    -> Note that this apprach is only available for Kestrel profiles and not IIS Express
    (dotnet run --launch-profiles IIS Express) cannot do this.

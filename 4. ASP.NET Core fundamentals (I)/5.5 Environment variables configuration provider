ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES CONFIGURATION PROVIDER:


- .NET and ASP.NET Core define some environment variables that can be used to configure the application.

- these specific variables have a prefix of DOTNET_, DOTNETCORE_, OR ASPNETCORE_.
    -> variable with DOTNET_ and DOTNETCORE_ prefix are used to configure the .NET runtime
    -> variable with ASPNETCORE_ prefix are used to configure ASP.NET Core.
        for eg, ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT variable is used to set the environment name.

- environment variables have a higher priority than the appsetting.json file, hence overrides the

    appsetting.json file
    -> PowerShell cmd to set environment variable:
        $Env:Database__Type="SQLite"

    -> PowerShell cmd to check if the environment variable is set correctly:
        $Env:Database__Type

- now if we make a request to any previous endpoints we will see a response contains "SQLite"
    despite of different value in appsetting.json.

- once the application is closed and rerunned again, the response will be from the
    appsetting.json file.

HOW TO CONFIGURE THE APPLICATION TO RUN IN THE PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT:

- there are several ways to change the environment.

- Create a appsettings.Production.json file.
    {
        "Database": {
        "Type": "PostgreSQL",
        "ConnectionString": "This is the database connection string from appsettings.Production.json"
        }
    }
    -> this configuration file will be used for the Production environment.

- we will specify the environment as Production to apply this configuration.

1) Using launchSettings.json file =>
    -> add a new profile 'production' in launchSettings.json as follows:

        "production": {
            "commandName": "Project",
            "dotnetRunMessages": true,
            "launchBrowser": true,
            "launchUrl": "swagger",
            "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7096;http://localhost:5161",
            "environmentVariables": {
                "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Production"
            }
        }

    -> use the run command with specifying the profile and make a request to endpoint
        https://localhost:7096/Configuration/database-configuration

        dotnet run --launch-profile production

    -> the response will be from the appsettings.Production.json.

2) Using the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable =>
    -> set the ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT environment variable to Production.

        $Env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = "Production"

    -> run the application with: dotnet run --no-launch-profile
    -> the response will be from the appsettings.Production.json.

3) Using the --environment argument =>
    -> another way is to set the environment with the --environment argument.

        dotnet run --environment Production

4) Using the launch.json file in VS Code =>
    -> if you don't see the .vscode folder open command pallet and run the 
        '.NET: Generate Assets for Build and Debug' command
    -> inside .vscode folder, set the environment in the launch.json file
        * add a new configuration following the existing one. (see EnvironmentDemo)
    -> now we will be able to see the '.NET Core Launch(Production)' option in the RUN AND DEBUG panel
    -> launch.json file is only used in VS Code RUN AND DEBUG. it is not used when we run the application
        using the dotnet run.

5) Using the launchSettings.json file in Visual Studio 2022 =>
    -> open Launch Profiles and change the value of "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT" into 'Production'.
    -> restart the application. (no dotnet watch run)

ENVIRONMENTS:

- we've seen that ASP.NET Core web api template contains 2 files:
    1) appsettings.json 
    2) appsettings.Development.json
- when we run the application using 'dotnet run', the application runs in the Development environment.
    so the configuration settings in the appsettings.Development.json file override the configuration
    setting in the appsettings.json file.
    (run the EnvironmentDemo and request the endpoint from Thunder Client)

UNDERSTANDING THE PRIORITIES OF CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES


- we've seen different ways to read configuration values and environment variables.

            Source                                          |                Priority
    ______________________________________________________________________________________
            Command-line arguments                                              1
            Non-prefixed environment variables                                  2
            User secrets(Development environment only)                          3
            appsettings.{Environment}.json                                      4
            appsettings.json                                                    5

            -> the lowest the number, the higher the prioprity.

- if other configuration providers are registered in the program file, the later registered
    providers have higher priority than the earlier registered providers.


- in terms of environment variables such as ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT, the following table shows
    the priorities.

        Command-line arguments                                                   1
        launchSettings.json (development purposes only)                          2
        Environment variable in the current process                              3

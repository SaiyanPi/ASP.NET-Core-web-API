RETRIEVING DATA:

- next, let's see how to retrieve data by ID.
- just like in the Querying data section, invoiceItems property will be empty. To include the collection
    navigation property we need to use the Include method in the LINQ query.

        [HttpGet("{id}")]
        public async Task<ActionResult<Invoice>> GetInvoice(Guid id)
        {
            var invoice = await context.Invoices
            .Include(x => x.InvoiceItems)
            .SingleOrDefaultAsync(x => x.Id == id);

            if (invoice == null)
            {
                return NotFound();
            }

            return invoice;
        }

ONE-TO-ONE RELATIONSHIPS:

- in one-to-one relationship, both side have a reference navigation property. Technically both sides have
    equal positions.
- however to explicitly configure the relationship, we need to specify which side is the dependent side
    and which side is the principal side. the foreign key is normally defined On the dependent entity side.
- in the EFCoreRelationshipIIDemo/Passport class we have defined the 'PersonId' as a foreign key which implies that 
    Person is a principal entity and Passport is the dependent entity.

    if we do not specify the foreign key property, EF Core will automatically choose one of the entities
    to be the dependent entity. However, because Contact and Address are equal in a one-to-one relationship,
    EF Core may not choose the correct entity as we expect. So, we need to explicitly define a foreign key 
    property in the dependent entity.

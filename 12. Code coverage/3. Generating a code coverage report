Generating a coverage report:

- To better understand the coverage data, we can generate a code coverage report. To do this, we can
    use the ReportGenerator NuGet package.
- ReportGenerator is a tool that can convert coverage data generated by Coverlet into human-readable
    reports. It also supports other coverage formats, such as OpenCover, dotCover, NCover, and so on.

a) To install ReportGenerator, we can run the following command:
    
    cmd: dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

b) now, to generate a code coverage report:

    cmd: reportgenerator "-reports:TestResults\c78827ba-f2e7-4a40-bd35-13f08e721f1a\coverage.cobertura.xml" "-targetdir:coveragereport" "-reporttypes:Html;HtmlSummary"

    -> Please update the paths in the preceding command to match your project structure.
    -> If the command runs successfully, you will see the generated HTML report in the coveragereport
        folder
        (see the folder in the test project)
    -> You can open the index.html file in the browser to view the report.

GitHub Actions:

- To demonstrate how to use GitHub Actions, we will use BasicWebApi and it's test project(GitHubActionDemo).
    Directory structure of the source code is as follows:

            GitHubActionDemo
            |
            |--- src
            |     |---BasicWebApi
            |
            |--- tests
            |      |---BasicWebApi.UnitTest
            |      |---BasicWebApi.IntegrationTest

CI/CD concepts and terminologies:

- it is essential to understand key concepts and terminologies commonly used in CI/CD. Following are some
    of the most common terms used in CI/CD.

1) pipelines
-> pipeline is an automated process used to build, test, and deploy application.
-> They can be triggered manually or automatically and can even be set up tp be triggered by other
    pipelines.
-> This helps streamline the development process, ensuring that application are built, tested, and deployed
    quickly and efficiently.

2) Build
-> A build is a process that involves compiling the source code and creating the necessary binaries or
    Docker images.
-> This ensures that the code is ready for deployment.

3) test
-> A pipeline may include automated tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, or
    end-to-end(E2E) TESTS. These tests can be incorporated into the pipeline to ensure that the code changes
    do not break any existing functionalities.
-> This helps to ensure that the software remains stable and reliable.

4) Artifact
-> An artifact is a file or collection of files - normally, the output of a build process.
-> examples of artifact include binary files, a docker image, or a zip file containing the binary files.
-> these artifacts can then be used as inputs for the deployment process.

5) Containerization
-> Containerization is a method of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container image,
    which can be deployed and run in a consistent environment, regardless of the host operating system.
-> one of the most popular containerization tool is Docker.
-> Containerization offers numerous benefits, such as improved scalability, portability, and resource
    utilization.

6) VCS
-> VCSs are an essential tool for software development, allowing developers to track and manage changes
    to source code.
-> Git is one of the most widely used VCSs, providing developers with an effective way to manage their
    code base.

7) Deployment
-> Deployment is the process of deploying the application to the target environment .
-> It envolves configuring the application to meet the requirements of the environment, as well as ensuring
    that it is secure and ready for use.

8) triggered
-> A trigger is an event that tells the pipeline when to run. A trigger can be manual or automatic.
    for eg, a pull request can trigger the CI pipeline to validate code changes by running tests.
            a merge to the main branch can trigger the CI pipeline to build and publish artifacts.
-> a successful CI pipelines can trigger the CD pipelines to deploy the application to non-production
    environments. However, the CD pipeline may need to be triggered manually to deploy the application
    to the production environments AS A SAFETY MEASURE.

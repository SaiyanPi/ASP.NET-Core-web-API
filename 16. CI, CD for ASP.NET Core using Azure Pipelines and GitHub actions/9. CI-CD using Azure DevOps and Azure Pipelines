- Azure DevOps is free for open-source projects and small teams. We will not cover all the features. Let us
    focus on Azure Pipelines. In this section, we will discuss how to use Azure Pipelines to build and
    deploy our ASP.NET Core application to Azure App Service.
    We will need these resources before we can deploy the application to Azure:
    • Azure DevOps account: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops.
    • Azure subscription: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/. You can sign up for a free account here.
                            You will get some free credits to use Azure services.
    • GitHub repository: You need a GitHub repository to host the source code. The pipeline will be
                            triggered when code changes are committed to the repository

Running a Docker container:

- to run a Docker image in the container, we can use the docker run command. The following command will run
    the 'basicwebapidemo' image we built in the previous section.

    cmd: docker run -d -p 81:8081 --name basicwebapidemo basicwebapidemo

    -> -d option isused to run the container in detached mode. meaning the container will run in the
        background. You can omit this option and then the container will run in the foreground, which means
        if you exit the terminal, the container will stop.
    -> -p option is used to publish a container's port(s) to the host. In this case we are publishing port
        8080 of the container to port 80 of the host.
    -> --name option is used to specify a name for the container. the last argument is the name of the
        image to run.
    -> we can also use the -it option to run the container in the interactive mode. this option allows you to
        run a command in the conatiner.
    -> in section 6, we learned that EXPOISE instruction exposes the ports 8080 and 8181 to the container
        only. to publish the internal container port to the host, we need to use the -p option.
        The first port number is the port of the host machine, and the second port number is the internal
        container port.
        In this example, we are exposing the container port 8080 to the host port 80.
        Also, sometimes the port number of the host machine may be occupied by another process. In this
        case, you will need to use a different port number.
    -> The output should return the container ID, which is a UID for the container, such as this:
            86a49c1bad624af57bb9804d05bb651811f273346cddc13aa69a5fac59b7ce92

- to list all running containers:

    cmd: docker ps
    o/p: 
    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                CREATED           STATUS         PORTS                          NAMES
    86a49c1bad62   basicwebapidemo   "dotnet BasicWebApiDâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:81->8081/tcp   basicwebapidemo

    -> in the o/p we can see that the port 8081 of the container has been mapped to port 81 of the host.

- to list all containers in all states just add a -a option

    cmd: docker ps -a

    -> if the container is running, the STATUS should be 'Up'.

- we can use the following commands to manage containers:
    i) to pause the container:      docker pause <container name or ID>
    ii) to restart a container:     docker restart <container name or ID>
    iii) to stop a container:       docker stop <container name or ID>
    iv) to remove a container:      docker rm <container name or ID>

What is gRPC?

- One of the most popular RPC frameworks is gRPC.
- It is a high-performance, open-source modern RPC framework for building network services and
    distributed applications.
- gRPC was initially created by Google, which used a RPC framework called Stubby. In March 2015, 
    Google decided to make it open-source, resulting in gRPC, which is now used in many organizations
    outside of Google.
- gRPC has some awesome features, such as the following:
    • Interoperability: gRPC uses a Protocol Buffer (protobuf) file to declare services and messages,
        which enables gRPC to be completely language- and platform-agnostic. You can find gRPC
        tools and libraries for all major programming languages and platforms.
    • Performance: protobuf is a binary format, which has a smaller size and faster performance
        than JSON. It is not readable by humans, but it is readable by computers. HTTP/2 also supports
        multiplexing requests over a single connection. It needs fewer resources, even in slower networks.
    • Streaming: gRPC is based on the HTTP/2 protocol, which makes it support bidirectional streaming.
    • Productivity: Developers author protobuf files (.proto) to describe services with input
        and output. Then, they can use the .proto files to generate stubs for different languages or
        platforms. It is similar to the OpenAPI specification. Teams can focus on business logic and
        work on the same service in parallel.
    • Security: gRPC is designed to be secure. HTTP/2 is built on top of Transport Layer Security
        (TLS) end-to-end encrypted connection. It also supports client certificate authentication.

    With these benefits, gRPC is a good choice for microservices-style architecture.

- While gRPC offers some advantages over RESTful APIs, it is not considered a complete replacement.
    gRPC is an excellent choice for high-performance, low-latency communication between microservices,
    but RESTful APIs are more suitable for web-based applications and scenarios where simplicity,
    flexibility, and wide adoption are more critical.

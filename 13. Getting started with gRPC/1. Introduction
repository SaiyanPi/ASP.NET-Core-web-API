- Besides RESTful APIs, there are other types of APIs. One of them is the remote procedure call
    (RPC)-based API.
- gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework developed by Google. Now, it is an open-source project
    under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and it is becoming more and more popular.
- ASP.NET Core provides a set of gRPC tools to help us build gRPC services. In this chapter, we will
    introduce the fundamentals of gRPC and Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) messages.
- First, we will learn how to define protobuf messages and gRPC services. Then, we will learn how to
    implement gRPC services in ASP.NET Core, empowering us to communicate seamlessly between different
    applications.
    We will be covering the following topics in this chapter:
    • what is gRPC
    • Setting up a gRPC project
    • Defining gRPC services and messages
    • Implementing gRPC services and clients
    • Consuming gRPC services in ASP.NET Core applications

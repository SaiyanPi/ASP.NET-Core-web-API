MAPPING CONVENTIONS:

- there are some conventions in EF Core for mapping the models to the database.
    -> database uses the dbo schema by default.
    -> table name is the plural form of the model name. (model name: Invoice | database name: Invoices)
    -> column name is the property name.
    -> data type of the column is based on the property type and the database provides.
           
            NET type        |       SQL Server data type
            ---------------------------------------------
                int                     int
                long                    bigint
                string                  nvarchar(max)
                bool                    bit
                datetime                datetime
                double                  float
                decimal                 decimal(18,2)
                byte                    tinyint
                short                   smallint
                byte[]                  varbinary(max)

    -> if a property is named Id or <entity name>Id, EF Core will map it to the primary key.
    -> EF Core detects that the relationship between two models is one-to-many, it will map the navigation
        property to a foreign key column in the database automatically.
    -> If a column is a primary key, EF Core will create a clustered index for it automatically.
    -> If a column is a foreign key, EF Core will create a non-clustered index for it automatically.
    -> an enum type is mapped to the underlying type of the enum
        for eg, the InvoiceStatus enum is mapped to the int type in the database.

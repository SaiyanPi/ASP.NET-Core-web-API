(how EF Core knows the names of columns and tables in the database?)

COINFIGURING THE MAPPING BETWEEN MODELS AND DATABASE:


- EF Core maps the models to the database automatically this is because EF Core has a set of built-in
    conventions to configure the mappings.
- we can also explicitly customize the configuration to meet our needs.
- There are two ways to explicitly configure the mapping between the models and the database:
    • Data annotations
    • Fluent API

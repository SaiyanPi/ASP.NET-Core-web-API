Visualizing the GraphQL schema:

- When the GraphQL API becomes more complex, it is difficult to understand the schema. We can use
    GraphQL Voyager to visualize the GraphQL schema.
- GraphQL Voyager is an open-source project that can visualize the GraphQL schema in an interactive
    graph. It is a frontend application that can be integrated with the GraphQL API.
- To use GrapgQL Voyager in our ASP.NET Core application, we can use the GraphQL.Server.Ui.Voyager 
    package. This package is part of the GraphQL.NET project.

1) Install the GraphQL.Server.Ui.Voyager package in our application.

    cmd: dotnet add package GraphQL.Server.Ui.Voyager

2) Add the following code to the Program.cs file:

    app.MapGraphQL();
    app.MapGraphQLVoyager();
    // omitted

    * the preceeding code adds a middleware that maps the Voyager UI to the deafult URL /ui/voyager.
    * if we want to specify a different URL, we can pass the URL as a parameter like

        app.MapGraphQLVoyager("/voyager");

3) Run the application and navigate to /voyager URL. we will see the page (see voyager.png):

Using Variables in query:

-> In this section, we will discuss how to use variables in queries.
-> GraphQL allows you to use variables in queries.
-> This is useful when you want to pass parameters to the query. We can create a query that accepts
    an id parameter and returns the teacher with the specified ID. 

1) Add a GetTeacher() method in the Query class, as follows:

    public async Task<Teacher?> GetTeacher(Guid id, [Service] AppDbContext context) =>
        await context.Teachers.FindAsync(id);

2) Now, we can use the $ sign to define a variable in the query.
    for eg, we can use the following query to get a teacher by ID:

        query getTeacher($id: UUID!) {
            teacher(id: $id) {
                id
                firstName
                lastName
                email
                phone
            }
        }

    * preceding query defines a variable named id of the UUID! type.
    * The ! sign indicates that the variable is non-nullable.
    * The teacher field takes the id variable as the parameter and returns the teacher with the
        specified ID.
    * In the GraphQL Variables panel, you can define the id variable to pass the value to the query,
        as follows:

        {
            "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000401"
        }
    
    * You can define multiple variables in the query.
    
    Note that variables must be scalars, enums, or input object types.

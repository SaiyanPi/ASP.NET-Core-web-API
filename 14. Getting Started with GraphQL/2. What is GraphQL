What is GraphQL:

-> GraphQL offers a flexible way to query and mutate data.
-> The main difference between GraphQL and REST is that GraphQL allows clients to specify the
    data they need, whereas REST APIs return a fixed set of data.
-> GraphQL treats data as a graph, and it uses a query language to define the shape of the data.
    This addresses the issues of over-fetching and under-fetching data by enabling clients to specify
    their data requirements. Additionally, it supports mutations, empowering clients to modify data
    as needed.
-> While REST APIs have multiple endpoints for different resources, GraphQL is typically served over
    a single endpoint, usually /graphql, which exposes a schema that describes the data. All queries
    and mutations are sent to this endpoint.
-> The schema is defined using a GraphQL Schema Definition Language, which is the contract between
    the client and the server.
-> The schema defines the types of data and the operations that can be performed on the data.
    The client can use the schema to validate the query and mutation requests.
->  However, the backend development is more complex than REST APIs.
-> GraphQL uses resolvers to fetch data from different levels of the graph. If the implementation of
    the resolvers is not efficient, it can lead to performance issues.
-> ASP.NET Core does not have built-in support for GraphQL. However, several third-party libraries
    can be used to create GraphQL APIs:

    • HotChocolate:
        HotChocolate is an open-source GraphQL server for .NET. It is built on top of
        ASP.NET Core and supports the newest GraphQL October 2021 specification. It is supported by
        ChilliCream, a company that provides GraphQL tooling and consulting services. ChilliCream
        also provides other products, such as Banana Cake Pop, which is a GraphQL IDE to create
        and test GraphQL queries, and Strawberry Shake, which is a GraphQL client library for .NET.
        You can find more information about HotChocolate at https://chillicream.com/docs/hotchocolate/.
    
    • GraphQL.NET: 
        GraphQL.NET is another open-source GraphQL implementation for .NET.
        It provides a set of libraries that can be used to create GraphQL APIs and clients.
        You can find more information about GraphQL.NET at https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/.

    In this chapter, we will use HotChocolate to create a GraphQL API in ASP.NET Core.

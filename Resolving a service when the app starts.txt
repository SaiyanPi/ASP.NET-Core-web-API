RESOLVING THE SERVICE WHEN THE APP STARTS:

- if we need SERVICE in the program.cs file, we cannot use constructor injection.

- for this we can resolve a scoped service for a limited duration at app startup.

- for example, let's say we want to display a message from SayWassup() method from
    DemoService from program/app startup to close, therefore we want an access to 
    SERVICE(DemoService) in program.cs file.

            var app = builder.Build();

            using (var serviceScope = app.Services.CreateScope())
            {
                var services = serviceScope.ServiceProvider;
                var demoService = services.GetRequiredService<IDemoService>();
                var message = demoService.SayWassup();
                Console.WriteLine(message);
            }

            -> preceding code creates a scope and resolves the IDemoService service
                from the service container. After the scope is disposed of, the service
                will be disposed of as well.

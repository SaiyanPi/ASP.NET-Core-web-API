GROUP REGISTRATION:

- as the project grows, we may have more and more services. If we register all services in Program.cs
  this file will be very large. for this case we can use group registration to register multiple
  services at once.
  
- we can create a class extension.
          public static class LifetimeServicesCollectionExtensions
          {
          }

- inside the class we can create an extension method for the IServiceCollection interface and use it
  to register all services at once.
          public static class LifetimeServicesCollectionExtensions
          {
            public static IServiceCollection AddLifetimeServices(this
            IServiceCollection services)
            {
              services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();
              services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();
              services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
              return services;
            }
          }

- now inside the service container, we can register extension containing group of services like:

            builder.Services.AddLifetimeServices();

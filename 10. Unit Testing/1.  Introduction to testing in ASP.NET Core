Introduction to testing in ASP.NET Core:

- different types of testing can be performed on an ASP.NET Core web API application.

a) Unit Testing:
    - this process of testing individual units of code, such as methods and classes, to ensure
        that they work as expected.
    - Unit tests should be small, fast, and isolated from other units of code.
    - Mocking frameworks can be used to isolate units of code from their dependencies, such as
        databases and external services.
    
b) Integration testing:
    - This involves testing the integration between different components of the application to ensure
        that they work together as expected.
    - Generally, integration tests are slower than unit tests. 
    - Integration tests may use mock objects or real objects, depending on the scenario.
        For example, if the integration test is to test the integration between the application and a
        database, then a real database instance should be used. But if the integration test is to
        test the application’s integration with an external service, such as a payment service, then
        we should use a mock object to simulate the external service.
    -  In the microservices architecture, integration tests are more complicated, as they may involve
        multiple services. Besides the integration tests for each service, there should also be
        integration tests for the entire system.

c) End-to-end testing:
    - This is the process of testing the application from the user’s perspective to ensure that the
        entire system from start to finish, including the user interface, the web API, the database,
        and more, is working as expected.

d) Regression testing:
    - This involves testing whether the application still works as expected after new features are
        added or bugs are fixed.
    - Regression testing is usually performed after the application is deployed to a production
        environment. It helps to ensure that the new features or bug fixes don’t break existing
        functionality.

e) Load testing:
    - This involves testing whether the application can handle a normal load of users and requests.
        It helps to set the baseline for the performance of the application.
    
f) Stress testing:
    - This involves testing whether the application can handle extreme conditions, such as a sudden
        spike in the number of users and requests, or gradually increasing the load over a long period. 
    - It also determines whether the application can recover from failures and how long it takes to
        recover.

g) Performance testing:
    - This is a type of testing that evaluates the performance of the application under different
        workloads, including response time, throughput, resource usage, and more.
    - Performance testing is a superset of load testing and stress testing.
    - Generally, unit testing and integration testing are performed in the development environment and the
        staging environment, while performance testing is performed in a production-like environment,
        such as a user acceptance testing (UAT) environment, which closely mirrors the production 
        environment in terms of infrastructure and configuration.

- Unit testing and integration testing are the most common types of testing that are written in .NET
    by developers.

Diving deeper into authorization:

- authorization is the process of determining whether a user is allowed to perform a specific acton.
- In the previous section, we implemented a web API project that enables simple authentication and
    authorization. By using the Authorize attribute, only authenticated users can access the API.
    However, in many scenarios, we need to implement granular authorization.
    For example, some resources are only accessible to the administrator, while some resources are
    accessible to normal users.
- In this section, we will explore how to implement granular authorization in ASP.NET Core, including
    role-based authorization, claim-based authorization, and policy-based authorization.

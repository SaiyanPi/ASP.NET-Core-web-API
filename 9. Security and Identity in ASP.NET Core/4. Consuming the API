Consuming the API:

- see sample client application AuthenticationDemoClient. it is a simple console application.
- it uses the HttpClient class to send HTTP request to the API.

- Consuming Web API(AuthenticationDemo) from console appp(AuthenticationDemoClient)

    1) dotnet run/dotnet watch run the API.

    2) run the console app and enter the registered username and password in console window.

        -> first, the client application sends a request to the login API to get the token.

            var request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Post, "http://localhost:5136/Account/login");

        -> then, it attaches the token to the request header and sends the request to the weather forecast
            API.

            request = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Get, "http://localhost:5136/WeatherForecast");
            request.Headers.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", token);

        -> if the token is valid, the API will return the data.
        
        -> see image consumingAPIconsole.png for console output.

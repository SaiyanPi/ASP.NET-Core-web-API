Building SignalR clients:

- This section will demonstrate how to use SignalR in different platforms by building three SignalR
    clients that consume the same SignalR hub provided by the ChatApp.Server application.
- The code for SignalR is largely the same across platforms, making it easy to learn and implement in
    your own applications. As such, you can refer to any of these applications to gain an
    understanding of how to consume a SignalR service in your client applications.

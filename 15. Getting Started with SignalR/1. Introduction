Getting started with SignalR:

- Various technologies can be used to implement real-time web APIs, such as gRPC streaming, long 
    polling, Server-Sent Events (SSE), WebSockets, and so on.
-  Microsoft provides an open-source library called SignalR to simplify the implementation of
    real-time web APIs.
- In this chapter, we will introduce the basics of SignalR and how to use SignalR to implement
    real-time web APIs. We will cover the following topics in this chapter:
    • Recap of real-time web APIs
    • Setting up SignalR
    • Building SignalR clients
    • Using authentication and authorization in SignalR
    • Managing users and groups
    • Sending messages from other services
    • Configuring SignalR hubs and clients
    By the end of this chapter, you will be able to use SignalR to implement real-time web APIs.

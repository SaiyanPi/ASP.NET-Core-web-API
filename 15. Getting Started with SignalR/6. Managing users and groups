Managing users and groups:

- in the previous section, we implemented basic authentication and authorization for the SignalR server. we
    also updated clients to authenticate users.
- in this section, we will explore how to manage users and groups in SignalR.
    we want to add features to the Chat App to enable the following:
    • Allow users to know who is connected to the chat app
    • Allow users to send a message to a specific user
    • Allow users to join groups
    • Allow users to send a message to a specific group

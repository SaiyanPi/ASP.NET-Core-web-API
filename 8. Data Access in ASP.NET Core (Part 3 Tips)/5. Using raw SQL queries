USING RAW SQL QUERIES:

- althougfh EF Core can translate most LINQ queries into SQL queries, which is very conevnient,
    sometimes we need to write raw SQL queries if the required query cannot be written in LINQ,
    or generated SQL query is not effecient.
- EF Core provides several methods to execute raw SQL queries:
    1) FromSql()
    2) FromSqlRaw()
    3) SqlQuery()
    4) SqlQueryRaw()
    5) ExecuteSql()
    6) ExecuteSqlRaw()

- when we execute raw SQL queries, we must be careful to avoid SQL injection attacks.

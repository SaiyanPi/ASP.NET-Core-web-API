OTHER ORM FRAMEWORKS:

- In addition to EF Core, there are numerous other ORM frameworks available for .NET. Some of the
    most popular include the following:

    • Dapper (https://dapperlib.github.io/Dapper/):
        Dapper is a micro-ORM framework that is designed to be fast and lightweight. Dapper does not
        support change tracking, but it is easy to use, and it is very fast. As the official
        documentation says, “Dapper’s simplicity means that many features that ORMs ship with are
        stripped out. It worries about the 95% scenario and gives you the tools you need most of the
        time. It doesn’t attempt to solve every problem.” The performance is one of the most important
        features of Dapper. Maybe it is not fair to compare Dapper’s performance with EF Core, because
        EF Core provides many more features than Dapper. If you are looking for a simple ORM framework
        that is fast and easy to use, Dapper is a good choice. In some projects, Dapper is used with
        EF Core to provide the best of both worlds. Dapper is open-source and originally developed by
        Stack Overflow.

    • NHibernate (https://nhibernate.info/):
        Like NUnit, NHibernate is a .NET implementation of the Hibernate ORM framework in Java.
        It is a mature, open-source ORM framework that has been around for a long time. It is very 
        powerful and flexible. NHibernate is maintained by a community of developers.

    • PetaPoco (https://github.com/CollaboratingPlatypus/PetaPoco): 
        PetaPoco is a tiny, fast, easy-to-use micro-ORM framework, which only had 1,000+ lines of code
        in the original version. PetaPoco has a similar performance to Dapper because it uses dynamic
        method generation (MSIL) to assign column values to properties. PetaPoco now supports SQL 
        Server, SQL Server CE, MS Access, SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Firebird DB, and Oracle.
        It uses T4 templates to generate the code. PetaPoco is open-source and currently maintained
        by a few core developers.

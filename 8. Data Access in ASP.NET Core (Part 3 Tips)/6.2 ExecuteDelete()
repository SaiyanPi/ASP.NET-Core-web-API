ExecuteDelete():

- for example let's delete all invoices with status 'AwaitPayment'.

    [HttpDelete]
    [Route("status/await")]
    public async Task<ActionResult> DeleteInvoicesByStatus(string status)
    {
        var result = await context.Invoices.Where(x => x.Status == InvoiceStatus.AwaitPayment)
            .ExecuteDeleteAsync();
        return Ok();
    }

    endpoint: api/invoice/status/await?status=awaitpayment

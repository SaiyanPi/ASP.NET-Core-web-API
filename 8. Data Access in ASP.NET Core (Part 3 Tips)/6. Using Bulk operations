USING BULK OPERATIONS:


- EF Core 7.0 or later offersd the ability of bulk operations, which are easy to use and can improve
    the performance of UPDATE/DELETE operations.
- as discussed previously, EF Core tracks the changes in entities. To update entity, normally, we
    need to load the entity from the database, update the entity properties, and then call the
    SaveChanges() method to save the changes to database. Deleting the entity is similar.
- However, if we want to update or delete a large number of entities, it is not effecient to
    load the entities one by one and then update or delete them. For these scenarios, it is not
    required to track the changes in the entities. So it would be better to use the bulk operations
    feature to update or delete data
- we can use raw SQL query to update or delete the data using ExecuteSql() method. However, it
    lacks strong type support. Hardcoding the column names in the SQL query is not a good 
    practice.
- So we can use ExecuteUpdate() and ExecuteDelete() methods to update or delete data. Note that these 
    two methods do not invlove the entity tracking feature. So once we call these two methods, the 
    changes will be executed immediately. There is no need to call the SaveChanges() method.

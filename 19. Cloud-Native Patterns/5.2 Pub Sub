Pub/Sub:

- In a microservice architecture, the microservices communicate with each other through standard 
    interfaces, such as HTTP APIs or gRPC.
- Sometimes, a microservice may need to communicate with other services in an asynchronous way. It may
    also need to broadcast an event to multiple services. The pub/sub pattern can be used to address the
    need for loosely coupled communication between microservices.
- It facilitates broadcasting events or messages to multiple subscribers without them being directly
    aware of each other.
- The pub/sub pattern is a communication model that facilitates the exchange of messages between 
    publishers and subscribers without requiring them to be aware of each other. It consists of three 
    components: publishers, subscribers, and a message broker.
    i) Publishers are responsible for publishing events or messages to the message broker, which then
        distributes them to subscribers.
    ii) Subscribers, in turn, subscribe to the message broker and receive the events or messages that
        have been published.
    This pattern allows for asynchronous communication between publishers and subscribers, enabling 
    them to remain independent of each other.

- Many message brokers can be used to implement the pub/sub pattern. Some popular message brokers 
    include the following:
    • RabbitMQ:
        RabbitMQ is an open-source, cross-platform message broker that is widely used in microservice
        architectures. It is lightweight and easy to deploy on-premises and in the cloud. 
        For more details, refer to the following link: https://rabbitmq.com/.

    • Redis:
        Redis is an open-source in-memory data structure store. It is versatile and has high performance.
        Redis is a popular choice for various use cases, such as key-value databases, caches, and message
        brokers. We learned how to use Redis as a cache in Chapter 15. It can also be used as a message
        broker to implement the pub/sub pattern. For more details, refer to the following link:
        https://redis.io/.

    • Apache Kafka:
        Apache Kafka is an open-source, distributed event-streaming platform. It is a reliable and
        scalable message broker that can be used to implement the pub/sub pattern. It ensures the
        durable and reliable storage of event streams in a scalable, fault-tolerant, and secure manner.
        You can manage it yourself or use a managed service provided by a variety of cloud providers.

    • Azure Service Bus:
        Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker provided by Microsoft Azure.
        It supports message queues and topics. For more details, refer to the following link:

- The pub/sub pattern decouples the microservices from each other. It also improves the scalability 
    and reliability. 
- All the messages or events are handled in an asynchronous way. This helps the service continue to
    function even if the workload increases or one of the services fails. However, it also increases
    the complexity of the system. You need to manage the message ordering, message priority, message
    duplication, message expiration, dead-letter queues, and so on.

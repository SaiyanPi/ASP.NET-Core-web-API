CQRS:

- CQRS is a powerful tool for addressing the challenge of scaling and optimizing read and write operations. 
    By separating the responsibilities for handling commands (writes) and queries (reads), CQRS enables 
    each operation to be optimized independently, resulting in improved scalability and efficiency.
- Traditionally, the data model of an application is designed to support both read and write operations.
    However, the requirements for read and write operations are often different. The read operations may 
    execute different queries, resulting in different DTO models. The write operations may need to update 
    multiple tables in the database.This may lead to a complex data model that is difficult to maintain. 
    In addition, the read operations and write operations may have different performance requirements.
- CQRS divides the application’s data model into separate models for reading and writing. This enables 
    the use of different storage mechanisms and optimizations tailored to the specific needs of each 
    operation.
- CQRS uses queries to read data and commands to update data. Queries do not change the state of the system,
    while commands do.
    For example, the read store can use multiple read-only replicas of the write store, which 
    can improve the performance of the read operations. The replicas must be kept in sync with the write 
    store, which can be done by using built-in database replication features or an event-driven mechanism.
    (SEE 5.1_CQRS_ARCHITECTURE.png)

- To implement CQRS in ASP.NET Core web API applications, you can use the MediatR library, 
    which is a simple mediator implementation in .NET. This library is a simple mediator implementation 
    in .NET that enables the use of the mediator pattern. The mediator pattern is a behavioral design 
    pattern that enables objects to interact without having to refer to each other explicitly. Instead, they 
    communicate through the mediator, which decouples the objects and allows for greater flexibility.
    (see 5.1_CQRS_architecture_using_MediatR_library.png)
    -> the mediator is responsible for receiving the commands and queries from the business logic layer and then
        invoking the corresponding handlers to execute the commands and queries.
    -> Then, the handlers can use the repositories to access the data persistence layer for reading and writing
        data.
    -> The business logic layer does not need to know how the mediator invokes the handlers. It only needs to
        send the commands and queries to the mediator.
    ->  This decouples the business logic layer from the data persistence layer. This pattern also makes it
        easier to send commands and queries to multiple handlers. For example, if we have a command to send an
        email notification to the customer and we need to add a text message notification, we can simply add a
        new handler to handle the command without changing the client code.

- Sample application (CqrsDemo\start)

    IMPORTANT NOTE:
        The sample project has a separate infrastructure project to implement the data persistence layer 
        by following clean architecture. When you run the dotnet ef command to add a migration or 
        update the database, you need to specify the startup project.
        for eg, to add a migration, you need to navigate to the CqrsDemo.Infrastructure project and run the
        following command:
        cmd:  dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate --startup-project ../CqrsDemo.WebApi
        cmd:  dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../CqrsDemo.WebApi

    This project contains a basic ASP.NET Core web API application to manage the invoices. It contains the
    following projects:
    • CqrsDemo.WebApi: This is the ASP.NET Core web API project. It contains the controllers and application 
        configurations.
    • CqrsDemo.Core: This is the core project that contains the domain models, interfaces of repositories,
        services, and so on.
    • CqrsDemo.Infrastructure: This project contains the implementation of the repositories.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Implementing the model mapping:

- In the core project, note that the service layer uses DTOs, as shown in the following:

    public interface IInvoiceService
    {
        Task<InvoiceDto?> GetAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<List<InvoiceWithoutItemsDto>> GetPagedListAsync(int pageIndex, int pageSize,
            CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<InvoiceDto> AddAsync(CreateOrUpdateInvoiceDto invoice, 
            CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        Task<InvoiceDto?> UpdateAsync(Guid id, CreateOrUpdateInvoiceDto invoice,
            CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
        // Omitted
    }

    -> These methods use different DTO types for reading and writing.
    -> a) To map the entities to DTOs and vice versa, we can use AutoMapper, which is a popular object-to-object
        mapper library. The following code shows how to configure AutoMapper in the InvoiceProfile.cs file:

        public InvoiceProfile()
        {
            CreateMap<CreateOrUpdateInvoiceItemDto, InvoiceItem>();
            CreateMap<InvoiceItem, InvoiceItemDto>();
            CreateMap<CreateOrUpdateInvoiceDto, Invoice>();
            CreateMap<Invoice, InvoiceWithoutItemsDto>();
            CreateMap<Invoice, InvoiceDto>();
        }

    -> b) Then, we can register AutoMapper in the Program.cs file as follows:

        builder.Services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(InvoiceProfile));

    -> c) to use the mapper, simply inject the IMapper interface into the service layer as:

        public class InvoiceService(IInvoiceRepository invoiceRepository, IMapper mapper) : IInvoiceService
        {
            public async Task<InvoiceDto?> GetAsync(Guid id, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
            {
                var invoice = await invoiceRepository.GetAsync(id, cancellationToken);
                return invoice == null ? null : mapper.Map<InvoiceDto>(invoice);
            }
            // Omitted
        }

        Using AutoMapper can save us a lot of time for mapping the entities to DTOs and vice versa. Next, 
        we can implement the queries and commands using the MediatR library.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Implementing queries:

- Next, we will implement the CQRS pattern using the MediatR library. Follow these steps:

1) First, we need to install the MediatR NuGet package. Install the MediatR package to the CqrsDemo.Core project
    and the CqrsDemo.WebApi project.

    cmd:  dotnet add package MediatR

    -> IMediator:
        This is the main interface of the MediatR library. It can be used to send requests to the handlers.
        It can also be used to publish events to multiple handlers.
    -> ISender:
        This interface is used to send a request through the mediator pipeline to be handled by a single handler.
    -> IPublisher:
        This interface is used to publish a notification or event through the mediator pipeline to be handled by
        multiple handlers.
    -> The IMediator interface can be used to send all requests or events. For a clearer indication of the
        purpose of the request or event, it is recommended to use the ISender interface for requests handled
        by a single handler and the IPublisher interface for notifications or events that require multiple
        handlers.

2) Create a Queries folder in the CqrsDemo.Core project. Then, create a GetInvoiceByIdQuery.cs file in the
    Queries folder with the following code:

    public class GetInvoiceByIdQuery(Guid id) : IRequest<InvoiceDto?>
    {
        public Guid Id { get; set; } = id;
    }

    -> The preceding code defines a GetInvoiceByIdQuery class that implements the IRequest<InvoiceDto?> interface.
    -> This interface is used to indicate that this is a query that returns an InvoiceDto object.
        The Id property is used to specify the ID of the invoice to be retrieved.

3) Similarly, create a GetInvoiceListQuery.cs file in the Queries folder with the following code:

    public class GetInvoiceListQuery(int pageIndex, int pageSize) : IRequest<List<InvoiceWithoutItemsDto>>
    {
        public int PageIndex { get; set; } = pageIndex;
        public int PageSize { get; set; } = pageSize;
    }

    -> Note that the GetInvoiceListQuery query returns a list of InvoiceWithoutItemsDto objects. This is because
        we do not need the invoice items when listing the invoices.
    -> This is an example to show how to use different DTOs for reading and writing.


4) Next, create a Handlers folder in the Queries folder. Then, create a GetInvoiceByIdQueryHandler.cs file in
    the Handlers folder with the following code:

    public class GetInvoiceByIdQueryHandler(IInvoiceService invoiceService) : 
        IRequestHandler<GetInvoiceByIdQuery, InvoiceDto?>
    {
        public Task<InvoiceDto?> Handle(GetInvoiceByIdQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            return invoiceService.GetAsync(request.Id, cancellationToken);
        }
    }

    -> The GetInvoiceByIdQueryHandler class implements the IRequestHandler<GetInvoiceByIdQuery, InvoiceDto?>
        interface.
    -> This interface is used to indicate that this handler handles the GetInvoiceByIdQuery query and returns an
        InvoiceDto object.
    -> The Handle() method receives the GetInvoiceByIdQuery query and invokes the GetAsync() method of
        IInvoiceService to get the invoice by using the ID.
    -> Alternatively, you may choose to inject the IInvoiceRepository interface directly into the handler and
        implement business logic there. Ultimately, it is your decision where to store the logic. It is
        important to keep in mind that the goal is to separate business logic from the data persistence layer.

5) Similarly, create a GetInvoiceListQueryHandler.cs file in the Handlers folder with the following code:

    public class GetInvoiceListQueryHandler(IInvoiceService invoiceService) : 
        IRequestHandler<GetInvoiceListQuery, List<InvoiceWithoutItemsDto>>
    {
        public Task<List<InvoiceWithoutItemsDto>> Handle(GetInvoiceListQuery request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            return invoiceService.GetPagedListAsync(request.PageIndex, request.PageSize, cancellationToken);
        }
    }

- Now, we have two handlers to handle the GetInvoiceByIdQuery query and the GetInvoiceListQuery query. Next, we
    need to update the controllers to use the MediatR library.


6) Update the InvoicesController.cs file in the CqrsDemo.WebApi project with the following code:

    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    [ApiController]
    public class InvoicesController(IInvoiceService invoiceService, ISender mediatorSender) : ControllerBase
    {
        // Omitted
    }


7) Update the GetInvoice() method of the InvoicesController class with the following code:

    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<ActionResult<InvoiceDto>> GetInvoice(Guid id)
    {
        var invoice = await mediatorSender.Send(new GetInvoiceByIdQuery(id));
        return invoice == null ? NotFound() : Ok(invoice);
    }

    -> preceding code creates a GetInvoiceByIdQuery object that contains the id parameter.
    -> ISender interface will invoke the GetInvoiceByIdQueryHandler handler to handle the query. 
    -> Then, the handler will invoke the GetAsync method of the IInvoiceService to get the invoice via the ID.
        SO, THE CONTROLLER IS DECOUPLED FROM THE SERVICE LAYER.


8) Similarly, update the GetInvoices method of the InvoicesController class with the following code:

    [HttpGet]
    [Route("paged")]
    public async Task<ActionResultIEnumerableInvoiceWithoutItemsDto>>> GetInvoices(int pageIndex, int pageSize)
    {
        var invoices = await mediatorSender.Send(new GetInvoiceListQuery(pageIndex, pageSize));
        return Ok(invoices);
    }


9) Next, we need to register the MediatR in the Program.cs file as follows:

    builder.Services.AddMediatR(cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(typeof(GetInvoiceByIdQueryHandler).
        Assembly));

    ->  preceding code registers all three MediatR interfaces and the handlers in the CqrsDemo.Core project.

- Now, we use the queries to implement the read operations. You can run the application and test the 
    endpoints, such as /api/invoices/{id} and /api/invoices/paged. These endpoints should work as before.

Backends for frontends(BFFs):

- Backends for frontends (BFFs) address the challenge of efficiently serving diverse client interfaces 
    with distinct requirements.
- This is useful when applications need to serve multiple client types, such as web, mobile, and desktop.
    Each client type may need a different data format. In this case, a monolithic backend may struggle
    to cater to the unique needs of each client. Specifically, if the backend includes multiple
    microservices, each microservice may need to provide multiple endpoints to serve different client
    types. This can lead to a complex and inefficient system.
- BFF architecture is a useful solution for applications that need to serve multiple client types, such as 
    web, mobile, and desktop. Each client type may have distinct requirements for a data format, which 
    can be difficult to manage with a monolithic backend. If the backend includes multiple microservices, 
    each microservice may need to provide multiple endpoints to serve different client types, resulting in
    a complex and inefficient system. BFFs can help address this challenge by efficiently serving diverse 
    client interfaces with distinct requirements.
-  BFF introduces dedicated backend services tailored for specific frontend clients. Each frontend client 
    has its corresponding backend, enabling fine-grained control over data retrieval, processing, and 
    presentation. This allows for a more efficient and flexible system that can better meet the needs of 
    each client.

- BFF service is responsible for a specific frontend client. It can retrieve data from multiple microservices
    and combine the data into a single response. Each BFF service is fine-tuned to meet the specific needs of
    the frontend client.

- BFF_architecture.png illustrates how each BFF service is responsible for a particular frontend client.
    Each BFF service is tailored to meet the specific requirements of the frontend client. It can retrieve
    data from multiple microservices and combine them into a single response.

-  BFFs should be lightweight. They can contain client-specific logic but should not contain business 
    logic. The main purpose of BFFs is to tailor the data for each frontend client. However, this may lead to 
    code duplication. If the data format is similar for multiple frontend clients, BFFs may not be required.

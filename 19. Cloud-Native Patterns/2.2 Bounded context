Bounded context:

- A bounded context is a boundary that defines a domain model and serves as a delineated area of
    responsibility within a software system. It is like a linguistic territory in which a specific
    model holds meaning and relevance.

- In the realm of DDD, the concept of a bounded context is essential. By encapsulating a distinct
    understanding of the domain, bounded contexts promote clarity and precision in communication between
    domain experts and developers.

- Consider a scenario where we are building a web API for a banking system. Without bounded contexts, 
    the term Account could be interpreted differently in the Banking domain and the customer 
    relationship management (CRM) domain. This ambiguity can lead to confusion, misaligned 
    expectations, and ultimately, a fragmented understanding of the entire system. To avoid this, bounded 
    contexts should be used to clearly define the scope of the domain model.

- In many cases, a domain consists of several subdomains, each of which may refer to a distinct part of 
    the business domain, thus creating different bounded contexts. These bounded contexts communicate 
    with each other through programmatic interfaces, such as web APIs and message queues.

WHAT SHOULD/SHOULDN'T WE LOG?

- logging is a powerful tool to help us diagnose problems, monitor application, audit a system,
    and so on.
- but logging is not free, it consumes resources and may slow down our application.
- depending on the purpose of logging, we may need to log different information. Generally there
    are some scenario that we should log:
    • Input/output validation errors, such as invalid input parameters or invalid response data
    • Authentication and authorization failures
    • Application errors, exceptions, and warnings, such as database connection errors, network
        errors, and so on
    • Application startup and shutdown
    • High-risk operations, such as deleting a record from the database, changing a user’s password,
        transferring money, and so on
    • Legal compliance, such as auditing, terms of service, personal data consent, and so on
    • Critical business events, such as a new order being placed, a new user being registered, and so on
    • Any suspicious activities, such as brute-force attacks, account lockouts, and so on


WHAT INFORMATION SHOULD WE LOG?

- if the information in the log message is not sufficient to diagnose the peoblem, it would be 
    useless. generally we should log the following information:
    1) When: What time did the event happen?
    2) Where: What is the application name and version? What is the hostname or IP address?
        What is the module or component name?
    3) Who: Which user or client is involved in the event? What is the username, request ID, 
        or client ID?
    4) What: What is the event? What severity level does the event have? What is the error message
        or stack trace? Any other descriptive information?
- We may need to include more information based on the requirements. For example, for web API
    applications, we also need to log the request path, HTTP method, headers, status code, and so on.
    For database applications, we may need to log the SQL statement, parameters, and so on.


INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD NOT LOG:

    • Application source code
    • Sensitive application information, such as application secrets, passwords, encryption keys,
        database connection strings, and so on
    • Sensitive user information, such as personally identifiable information (PII); for example,
        health status, government identification, and so on
    • Bank account information, credit card information, and so on
    • Information that users do not consent to share
    • Any other information that may violate the law or regulations

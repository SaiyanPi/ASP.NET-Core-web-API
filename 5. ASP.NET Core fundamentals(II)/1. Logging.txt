LOGGING:


- A well designed logging system can capture data that helps diagnose problems and monitor
    the application in production.
- logging gives insight into how, when, where, and why significant system events occurred
    so that we know how the application is performing and how users are interacting with it.
- logging can also help sudit users activities and may also help to identify security weakness
    or potential attacks.

- logging should be fast and effecient, it should not affect any logic and the performance of the
    application.
- when adding logging to an application, we should consider the following points:
    -> what information should be logged?
    -> what format should log messages be in?
    -> where should log messages be sent?
    -> how long should log messages be kept?
    -> how to make sure log messages won't impact the performance of the application?

Error Handling:

- When an exception occurs in an ASP.NET Core web API application, the application will throw an exception.
    If this exception is not handled, the application will crash and cause a 500 error.
- The response body will contain the stack trace of the exception. Displaying the stack trace to the client 
    is acceptable during development. However, we should never expose the stack trace to the client in 
    production. The stack trace contains sensitive information about the application that can be used by 
    attackers to attack the application.

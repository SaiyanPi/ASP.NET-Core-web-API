Implementing a database health check:

-  In the previous section, we discussed how to implement a health check for a dependent service. 
    As databases are a common component of web API applications, this section will focus on how to 
    implement a database health check.  

1)  If you use EF Core to access the database, you can use the
    Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore package to implement a database 
    health check. This package provides a health check implementation for EF Core, so we do not need 
    to write the health check implementation ourselves.

    cmd: dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks.EntityFrameworkCore

2) In the sample project, we have an InvoiceDbContext class to access the database. The following 
    code shows how to register the InvoiceDbContext class in the application:

        builder.Services.AddDbContext<InvoiceDbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

3) Register the EF Core DbContext health check implementation, as follows:

        builder.Services.AddHealthChecks().
            AddDbContextCheck<InvoiceDbContext>("Database", tags: new[] { "database" });
        // omitted

        var app = builder.Build();

        // omitted
        app.MapHealthChecks("/database-health-checks",
            new HealthCheckOptions() { Predicate = healthCheck => healthCheck.Tags.Contains("database") });

- Run the application and send a GET request to the /database-health-checks endpoint. If the 
    database is healthy, the application will return a 200 OK response with Healthy in plain text in the 
    response body. Additionally, you can register multiple health checks for different databases if
    necessary.


IMPORTANT NOTE:
    If you are using other ORMs to access the database, you can create a custom health check 
    implementation following the previous section. This can be done by executing a simple query, 
    such as SELECT 1, to determine whether the database is functioning properly.

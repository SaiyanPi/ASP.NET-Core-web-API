Monitoring and observability:

-  In the real world, building an application is just the first step. We also need to monitor and observe 
    how the application is performing. This is where the concept of observability comes in.

-  In this section, we will discuss observability and how to use OpenTelemetry to monitor and observe
    applications.


WHAT IS OBASERVABILITY ?

-> In Chapter 5, we introduced logging in ASP.NET Core web API applications. We learned how to use 
    the built-in logging framework to log messages to different logging providers. 

-> Observability is a more comprehensive concept than logging. Besides logging, observability allows
    us to gain a deeper understanding of how the application is performing. For instance, we can determine
    how many requests are processed in a given hour, what the request latency is, and how requests are
    handled by multiple services in a microservice architecture. All of these are part of observability.

-> In general, observability has three pillars:

    • Logs:
    Logs are used to record what is happening within the application, such as incoming requests, outgoing
    responses, important business logic executions, exceptions, errors, warnings, and so on

    • Metrics:
    Metrics are used to measure the performance of the application, such as the number of requests, the
    request latency, error rates, resource usage, and so on. These metrics can be used to trigger alerts
    when the application is not performing well.

    • Traces:
    Traces are used to track the flow of requests across multiple services to identify where the 
    time is spent or where the errors occur. This is especially useful in the microservice architecture.

- There are a few different ways to implement observability in ASP.NET Core web API applications – we can
    update the source code to add logging, metrics, and traces or use tools to monitor and observe the
    application without changing the code.
    In this section, we will discuss the first approach by using OpenTelemetry to implement 
    observability in ASP.NET Core web API applications. This gives us more flexibility to customize the 
    observability aspect.

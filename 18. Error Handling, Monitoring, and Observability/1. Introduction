Error Handling, Monitoring, and Observability:

- In chapter 5, we introduced how to use logging in ASP.NET Core web API applications. Logging is a critical
    part of application development that helps the developers understand what's happening in their
    applications. However, logging is not enough - we need more tools to monitor and observe how our
    application is running. In this chapter we will explore the following topics:

    • Error handling

    • Health checks

    • Monitoring and observability

-  After reading this chapter, you will be able to understand how to monitor ASP.NET Core web API 
    applications. You will have gained knowledge of observability and OpenTelemetry, as well as how to 
    use some tools, such as Prometheus and Grafana, to monitor applications.
